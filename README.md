# audio_analyzer


## Introduction

The act of attempting to understand human emotion and affective states from speech is known as Speech Emotion Recognition. This takes use of the fact that tone and pitch in the voice often indicate underlying emotion.
The result of this project will be that when an audio file of a person speaking is given as input the model will say what type of emotion it is (fear, happy, angry or sad).
